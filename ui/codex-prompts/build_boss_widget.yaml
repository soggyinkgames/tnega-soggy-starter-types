description: >
  Create a responsive, mobile-first "Boss" widget that serves as the main
  command and prompt interface for Soggy Starters. It acts as the central
  controller where users can issue prompts, generate outputs, and switch
  between connected widgets such as spaced repetition cards, dashboards,
  or analytics.

instructions: |
  Build the following structure inside /ui/widgets/boss:

  /ui/widgets/boss/
   ├─ index.tsx              # main Boss widget entry
   ├─ useBoss.ts             # hook for managing state, input, and widget switching
   ├─ styles.css             # layout and animations
   ├─ types.ts               # optional shared types

  -----------------------
  🧭 Purpose
  -----------------------
  The Boss widget is the "home base" for users.
  It must:
  - Display a top title bar or app name (e.g. "Soggy Starters").
  - Include a text area or input field for prompt entry.
  - Include a "Send" button (or paper plane icon) to submit prompts.
