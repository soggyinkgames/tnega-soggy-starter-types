  eval-basic/          # deterministic checks (match/includes/fuzzy/json schema)
  eval-modelgraded/    # LLM-as-judge with rubric (helpfulness, coherence, factuality)
  eval-system/         # end-to-end agent/trace grading (RAG recall, tool correctness)
  eval-safety/         # Goal: detect unsafe, biased, or policy-violating outputs (moderation / PII / toxicity).
  eval-regression/     # Goal: compare the current agentâ€™s results to a stored baseline (for CI/CD gating)
